# fastapi-v2

`fastapi-v2` is a FastAPI application designed to build and serve RESTful APIs with support for asynchronous operations. This project serves as a template to kickstart FastAPI applications and includes a basic structure along with essential CRUD operations.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Ultra-fast framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python 3.6 type annotations.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Flexible SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for python applications.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Full support for asynchronous programming, taking advantage of Python's `async` and `await` keywords.
- **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server for hosting FastAPI applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi_v2.git
   cd fastapi_v2
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`building_basic_api/`**: Contains basic API structure and setup.
- **`crud_app/`**: Contains implementations for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.

### Running the Application

To run the application, use Uvicorn as the ASGI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

By default, the application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI at:

- [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- [ReDoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
